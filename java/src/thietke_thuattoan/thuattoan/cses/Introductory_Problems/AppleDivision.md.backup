>Time limit: 1.00 s Memory limit: 512 MB 

## Input

The first input line has an integer n: the number of apples.

The next line has n integers p1,p2,…,pn: the weight of each apple.

## Output

Print one integer: the minimum difference between the weights of the groups.

## Constraints

* 1≤n≤20
* 1≤pi≤109

## Example

Input:

* 5
* 3 2 7 4 1

Output:
1

>Explanation: Group 1 has weights 2, 3 and 4 (total weight 9), and group 2 has weights 1 and 7 (total weight 8).
