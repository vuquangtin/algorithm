# Grid Paths

There are 88418 paths in a 7Ã—7 grid from the upper-left square to the lower-left square. Each path corresponds to a 48-character description consisting of characters D (down), U (up), L (left) and R (right).

For example, the path

<img src='../../../../resources/images/cses/reitti.png'>

corresponds to the description 

```
DRURRRRRDDDLUULDDDLDRRURDDLLLLLURULURRUULDLLDDDD.
```
