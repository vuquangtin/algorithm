display = Display
control = Control
text = Text
next = Next
input = Input Data
clear = Clear
random = Insert Subtree
pause = Pause
insert = Insert Node
find = Find
insertion = Insertion
search = Search
Print = Print
help = Help
about = About
exit = Exit
heightNote = Note: a number up to each node is referred to its height.
greennode = Green node: 
greenmeans = a node is coloured green in the tree if the search for a number was found.
rednode = Red node: 
redmeans = a node changes colour from orange to red if the tree not contain the search for number.
orangenode = Orange node: 
orangemeans = a node containing a search for number.
bluenode = Blue node: 
bluemeans = a new node to be inserted into the tree.
ChangeL = Change language to
=
AnimationSpeed = Animation Speed
insertdone = The inserting finished.
searchdone = The search finished.
empty = The tree is empty.
alreadythere = The key is already in the tree.
found = Found.
notfound = Not found.
newroot = The tree is empty, So a new root creates and it becomes #1.

insertstart = A new node as a candidate looking for its place in the tree.
gotoleftside = Since #1 < #2 look at the left subtree.
gotorightside = Since #1 > #2 look at the right subtree.

searchstart = Searching starts at the root of the AVL tree.
searchleft = Since #1 < #2, look at the left subtree.
searchright = Since #1 > #2, look at the right subtree.

nodeinserted = Node has been inserted. Now it goes back and update the balance factor of nodes.
treeupdated = The balance factors updated.

avll =  The right subtree of the tree is too high, so it is required to perform a left rotation.
avlr = The left subtree of the tree is too high, so it is required to perform a right rotation.
avllr = The left subtree of the tree is too high, but its the right subtree is higher that the left subtree, so it is required to perform a left-right rotation.
avlrl =  The right subtree of the tree is too height, but its the left subtree is higher than the right subtree, so it is required to perform a right-left rotation.
